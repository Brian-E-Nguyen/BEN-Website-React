        I obtained a Bachelor's in Computer Science from California State
        University, Long Beach in 2020. From the moment I wrote my first Python
        script in my introductory CS course, I knew that coding is something I
        wanted to do in my life. It has allowed me to challenge myself and
        improve my skills, not just in programming, but also in creativity and
        team-working. Furthermore, I am grateful to have learned a myriad of
        technologies and concepts, and have connected with many people who have
        similar goals.

        I formerly worked at IdeaBank Marketing as a web developer. This role
        allowed me to work in a team to develop high-quality websites for
        clients that will not only fulfill but also exceed their expectations
      </p>

        I also formerly worked at Code Ninjas, Cerritos and Fullterton, as a
        coding instructor and an assistant director. Working here combines two
        of my passions: programming and working with students. I have tutored
        students with JavaScript, Lua, and C# languages to help them build
        high-quality software. I have also taught web development at various
        district schools to over 400 students.

        Apart from my programming passions, I formerly served as the president
        of the Tzu Chi Collegiate Association at CSULB. This volunteering
        organization focuses on humanitarian aid, medicine, education, and more.
        I have devoted over 300 hours of my time to serving this organization
        and it has been a life-changing experience for me.
