# Writing My Blogs with Org Mode

> 16 Feb, 2022 Â· 5 min

I used JSX to write my blogs, which helped me get the job done, but it was a
huge hassle. I had to worry about JSX syntax, bugs, CSS classes, etc. These
problems distracted me from the actual content creation.  After my blog files
were done, they ended up being a messy compilation filled with JSX syntax that
distracts the user from the actual text content.  This honestly demotivated me
from writing blogs

I knew I had to find a solution to this problem. Instead of using JSX, I had to
turn to my favorite markup language to do the work: Org Mode


## What is Org Mode?

Org Mode (also *org-mode*) is a type of markup language used in Emacs. I love
org-mode because its very versatile in what it can do. I use to to take notes,
write documents, make an agenda, and develop websites. It&rsquo;s my preferred markup language over Markdown (which I might explain more in a future blog)
