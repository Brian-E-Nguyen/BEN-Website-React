# Writing My Blogs with Org Mode

> 12 Jun, 2023 Â· 6 min

I used JSX to write my blogs, which helped me get the job done, but it was a
huge hassle. I had to worry about JSX syntax, bugs, CSS classes, etc. These
problems distracted me from the actual content creation.  After my blog files
were done, they ended up being a messy compilation filled with JSX syntax that
distracts the user from the actual text content.  This honestly demotivated me
from writing blogs

I knew I had to find a solution to this problem. Instead of using JSX, I had to
turn to my favorite markup language to do the work: Org Mode


## What is Org Mode?

Org Mode (also *org-mode*) is a type of markup language used in Emacs. I love
org-mode because its very versatile in what it can do. I use to to take notes,
write documents, make an agenda, and develop websites. It&rsquo;s my preferred markup
language over Markdown (which I will explain more in a future blog)


## Setup / Methods

Since there isn&rsquo;t a dedicated package specifically for converting org-mode to JSX, I had to adopt a two-step process. First, I wrote my documents in org-mode and then exported them to Markdown.

There are several packages that can help parse Markdown into JSX, like
`react-markdown` and `markdown-to-jsx`. Since I am using the Vite engine to build
this React app, I use the [vite-plugin-react-markdown](https://github.com/geekris1/vite-plugin-react-markdown) package for this website

Once this package is installed, I had to configure my `vite.config.js` file to
utilize the package and allow the app to include Markdown files

    // vite.config.js
    import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
    import Markdown from 'vite-plugin-react-markdown';
    import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';
    
    export default defineConfig({
      plugins: [
        Markdown(),
        react({
          include: [/\.tsx$/, /\.md$/], // <-- add .md
        }),
      ],
    });

Inside of my `Routes.js` file, I set it up so that each blog post has a prop
that has the name of the Markdown file

    // Routes.js
    ...
      {
        path: '/blog/volunteering-with-tzu-chi',
        key: 'Volunteering with Tzu Chi',
        component: BlogPostView,
        props: {
          title: `Volunteering with the Tzu Chi Foundation ${suffix}`,
          markdownFile: 'volunteering-tzu-chi',
        },
      },
    ...

When rendering my routes, I ensure that these props are passed into the components

    import ROUTES from './Routes';
    const RenderRoutes = () => {
      const location = useLocation();
    
      return (
        <Switch location={location} key={location.pathname}>
          {ROUTES.map((route) => (
            <Route
              path={route.path}
              key={route.key}
              exact={true}
              render={(props) => {
                <route.component {...props} {...route.props} />}
              }
          ))}
        </Switch>
      );
    };
    
    export default RenderRoutes;

For my blog posts, I set up a component called `BlogPostView` that retrieves a
Markdown file and parses it to JSX.

    import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
    import './BlogPostView.css';
    
    const BlogPostView = ({ markdownFile, title }) => {
      const [content, setContent] = useState(null);
    
      useEffect(() => {
        import(`../../../pages/blog/${markdownFile}.md`)
          .then((res) => {
            setContent(res.default);
          })
          .catch((err) => {
            console.log(`Failed to import Markdown: ${err}`);
          });
      }, [markdownFile]);
    
      return (
        {content && <>{content}</>}
      );
    };
    
    export default BlogPostView;

In my implementation, I established a state variable called `content`. When the
component is loaded, it retrieves the Markdown file from the prop that was
passed in. After successfully fetching the data, the component updates the state
variable &rsquo;content&rsquo; with that data.

    const BlogPostView = ({ markdownFile, title }) => {
      const [content, setContent] = useState(null);
    
      useEffect(() => {
        import(`../../../pages/blog/${markdownFile}.md`)
          .then((res) => {
            setContent(res.default);
          })
          .catch((err) => {
            console.log(`Failed to import Markdown: ${err}`);
          });
      }, [markdownFile]);
    
    ...


## CSS

When exporting Markdown to HTML, several HTML elements are commonly used to
represent different Markdown constructs. For example:

1.  Headings
    -   Markdown: `# Heading 1`
    -   HTML: `<h1>Heading 1</h1>`
2.  Paragraphs:
    -   Markdown: `This is a paragraph.`
    -   HTML: `<p>This is a paragraph.</p>`

org-mode lacks a built-in mechanism to apply CSS classes for exporting to
Markdown. Instead, I utilize element selectors to apply styles in such
scenarios. Below is a snippet from my `BlogPostView.css` file, showcasing the
styles I apply. Please note that I leverage the `vite-plugin-react-markdown`
class from the package to apply these styles effectively.

    /* BlogPostView.css */
    .vite-plugin-react-markdown h1 {
      text-align: center;
      margin-top: 200px;
    }
    
    .vite-plugin-react-markdown h2 {
      margin-top: 4rem;
      font-size: 2.4rem;
      text-transform: capitalize;
    }
    
    .vite-plugin-react-markdown pre {
      background-color: #363636;
    }
    
    .vite-plugin-react-markdown pre code {
      font-size: 1rem;
      overflow-x: auto;
      white-space: pre-wrap;
    }


## Issues I&rsquo;ve Encountered (and Solutions to Them)


### Images

org-mode doesn&rsquo;t have a way to export alt tags on images to Markdown

    // org-mode
    [[example.png][an example alt]]
    
    // exported md file
    ![img](example.png)

To get around this, I just had to include the exclamation symbol at the beginning of the org image line

    // org-mode
    ![[example.png][an example alt]]
    
    // exported md file
    ![an example alt](example.png)


### The `import` statement

This problem is specific if you&rsquo;re using Vite and `vite-plugin-react-markdown`.
If you&rsquo;re using a different method to rendering Markdown, ignore this section

When using dynamic imports, they must end with a file extension. From the `rollup` docs, in order to avoid unintended imports of files within a folder, it is
necessary for imports to conclude with a file extension within the static
portions of the import. This ensures that only the intended files are included
in the import process.

    // Not allowed
    import(`./foo/${bar}`);
    
    // allowed
    import(`./foo/${bar}.js`);

I had my import similar to the one below, which caused errors:

    import(`./path/to/markdownFile/${markdownFile}`)

Therefore, I had to change my import to this:

    import(`./path/to/markdownFile/${markdownFile}.md`)


## Conclusion

In conclusion, by transitioning to org-mode and leveraging Markdown with JSX, I
was able to overcome the hassles of JSX and streamline their blog writing
process, leading to a more efficient and enjoyable experience.

I hope your blogging experience to the next level by embracing the power of
structured and efficient writing. Whichever language resonates with you,
incorporating org-mode or Markdown into your blogging workflow will enhance your
productivity and streamline content creation. Say goodbye to distractions and
messy files, and hello to a seamless and enjoyable writing experience.
