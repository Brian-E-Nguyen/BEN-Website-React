I recently visited Universal Studios Hollywood on the 18th of June. This is the
first time I have been there after more than 10 years. Some things have stayed
the same, many things have changed, for better or for worse. Please note that
this blog has a lot of my personal opinions, and you are free to (dis)agree as
long as you respect my opinions.
