#+title: Maternity Photos

* My First Maternity Photography Session

As a photographer, I had the privilege of documenting my friends who are
expecting their first baby. This is also my very first maternity photoshoot, and
it was a memorable and enjoyable experience.

* Setting the Scene
I have a specialty when it comes to photography when the sun is setting at the
beach. The warm glow of the sun, the blue sky and the crashing waves is perfect
for a couple expecting a baby, so this is perfect for this occasion
