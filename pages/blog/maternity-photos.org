As a photographer, I had the privilege of documenting my friends who are
expecting their first baby. This is also my very first maternity photoshoot, and
it was a memorable and enjoyable experience.

** Setting the Scene
I have a specialty when it comes to photography when the sun is setting at the
beach. The warm glow of the sun, the blue sky and the crashing waves is perfect
for a couple expecting a baby, so this is perfect for this occasion

I wanted to make sure that my shots felt magical, so I had to utilize the sun in
the background for most of my shots

** Poses
I made sure that the couple are enjoying their time at the beach and that their
company underneath the blazing sun is surreal to them

** Color Grading
I wanted to utilize the sun's warm aura for my color grading

** Some challenges

** Additional Photos
