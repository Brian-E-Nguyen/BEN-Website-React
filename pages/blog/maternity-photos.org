I had the privilege of documenting my friends who are
expecting their first baby. This is also my very first maternity photo shoot, and
it was a memorable and enjoyable experience. All photos are taken with my new
Sigma 24-70mm with varying settings

Sunset photography is my specialty. The combination of the sun's warm glow and
the crashing waves create a perfect setting for this occasion. I ensured that
the couple is having a delightful experience at the beach, and that their
companionship underneath the scorching sun is a magical moment. To
achieve this, I positioned them in various poses and guided them through actions

I also wanted to utilize the sun's warm aura for my color grading. I
aimed for using only warm colors for my style rather than usual style of both
warm and cool colors. This is a new style that I wanted to try, and it turned
out well

In addition to capturing beautiful moments of the couple, it was equally
important to include photos of just the wife in the photos. As the main star of
the session, her presence and connection with the baby are significant and
deserved to be highlighted
