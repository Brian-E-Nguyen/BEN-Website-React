** The Purpose
Recently, I've observed that many online programming tutorials and tech
discussions are presented through blogs. As a result, I have decided to start
writing my own blog. The primary objectives of my blog are to share my knowledge
and experiences, as well as to enhance my writing skills. Additionally, through
writing blog posts, I can develop a better understanding of programming concepts
and gain a deeper understanding of myself.

** What can you expect?
I plan on providing my blogs with the following:

- *programming tutorials*  - these will be centered around web development, but I
  will focus on other programming fields too
- *my life*  - I enjoy documenting it to preserve my memories and share my
  experiences with others. This will give you a better understanding of me
  beyond my passion for web development.
