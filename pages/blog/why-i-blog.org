** The Purpose
Recently, I've observed that many online programming tutorials and tech
discussions are presented through blogs. As a result, I have decided to start
writing my own blog. The primary objectives of my blog are to share my knowledge
and experiences, as well as to enhance my writing skills. Additionally, through
writing blog posts, I can develop a better understanding of programming concepts
and gain a deeper understanding of myself.

** What can you expect?
I plan on providing my blogs with the following:

- *programming* - these will be cover a wide range of topics, not just limited to
  my field in web development
- *my life*  - I enjoy documenting my life to preserve my memories and share my
  experiences with others. This will give you a better understanding of me
  beyond my passion for programming.

** What makes my blogs different?
What I don't like about many online blogs is that they waste your time. For
example, the author presents a blog about a certain topic. Then, they would give
a brief history of that topic and other information that the reader doesn't care
about

*I value your time.* In these blogs, I focus on providing you with quality
knowledge and insights while respecting your time.

Additionally, I aim to focus on unique topics. These blogs won't be your typical
/React vs. Vue/ or /What is useState in React?/. Instead, I will delve into
lesser-explored topics that go beyond the mainstream.
