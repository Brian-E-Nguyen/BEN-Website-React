# Volunteering with the Tzu Chi Foundation

In Chinese, &ldquo;tzu&rdquo; means &ldquo;compassion,&rdquo; and &ldquo;chi&rdquo; means &ldquo;relief.&rdquo; &ldquo;With open arms
and helping hands, our volunteers are here to serve you.&rdquo; The Tzu Chi Foundation
is a global relief organization that focuses on charity, medicine, education,
and humanistic culture. This blog documents my experiences with this
organization starting from 2016 up until now.
