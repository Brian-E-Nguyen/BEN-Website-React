# Volunteering with the Tzu Chi Foundation

In Chinese, &ldquo;tzu&rdquo; means &ldquo;compassion,&rdquo; and &ldquo;chi&rdquo; means &ldquo;relief.&rdquo; &ldquo;With open arms
and helping hands, our volunteers are here to serve you.&rdquo; The Tzu Chi Foundation
is a global relief organization that focuses on charity, medicine, education,
and humanistic culture. This blog documents my experiences with this
organization starting from 2016 up until now.

## Becoming an Officer / Starting My Passion in Photography

During my first year with CSULB Tzu Ching, an officer was unable to fulfill her
role as historian, which involved taking photos at events for documentation
purposes. As someone who owned a DSLR camera but didn&rsquo;t use it much, I was
interested in the position and applied for it. The officer board found me to be
a good fit and was offered the position. The president of the organization told
me that my photography skills were not the primary factor in their decision, but
rather my dedication to the organization. I was thrilled for the chance to work
with the officers, improve my photography abilities, and contribute to CSULB Tzu
Ching through this role.


## Tzu Ching Social Day

The largest event ever held by CSULB Tzu Ching was the Tzu Ching Social Day on
February 25, 2017. This yearly event brought together Tzu Ching members from
various southern California colleges for a day of socializing and getting to
know one another. CSULB Tzu Ching hosted the event, with a focus on
environmental protection as the theme. Attendees included Tzu Ching members from
other colleges such as UC Irvine, UC San Diego, and UC Southern California.
During the event, the CSULB Tzu Ching officer board gave a presentation on how
Tzu Chi promotes environmental protection through initiatives such as using
recycled plastic to make clothes and promoting vegetarianism. This event was
also significant for me, as I fulfilled my new role as historian, and it remains
one of the most memorable events we&rsquo;ve hosted.
