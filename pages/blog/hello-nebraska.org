I am excited to share that I have *moved to Nebraska!*

Why am I doing so? Early this year, I found a web developer job posting from a
company called *IdeaBank Marketing*. I was intrigued by the services they offer
and the company culture, so I decided to reach out to one of the owners. I had a
couple of interviews with them, and I made it to the final stage of the
interview process. Eventually, they reached out to me if I would like to visit
Nebraska. I traveled there at the end of May to visit their company and meet
their coworkers.

A few days later, I received an offer from IdeaBank and I accepted it! I will
begin my position starting on the first week of July.
