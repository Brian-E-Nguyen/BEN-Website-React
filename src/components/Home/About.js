        My name is Brian E. Nguyen and I graduated from California State
        University, Long Beach in May 2020 with a bachelor's degree in computer
        science. I am currently seeking an internship or an entry-level position
        in full-stack development.

        From the moment I have written my first script in Python, I knew that
        software development is the career choice for me. It has allowed me to
        challenge myself and to improve on my skills, not just in programming,
        but also on creativity and team-working. I hope to produce high-quality
        and beautiful websites that will be used and appreciated by many.

        I am currently working at Code Ninjas, Cerritos as a coding instructor.
        Working here combines two of my passions: programming and working with
        kids. I tutor students with Scratch and JavaScript to help them build
        video games. Also, I have developed and led my own coding camp that
        received 100% positive feedback from students.

        I formerly served as the president of the Tzu Chi Collegiate Association
        at CSULB, a collegiate chapter of its mother organization, the Tzu Chi
        Foundation. This volunteering organization focuses on humanitarian aid,
        medicine, education, and more. I have devoted over 300 hours of my time
        serving this organization and it has been a life-changing experience for
        me. Various volunteering activities include recording videos for Tzu
        Chi's news outlet, packing food at food distributions, tutoring children
        at tutoring centers, and helping at medical outreaches. As an alumni, I
        continue to volunteer for the Tzu Chi Foundation and to support the
        CSULB chapter.
