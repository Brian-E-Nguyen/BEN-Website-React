        My name is Brian E. Nguyen and I graduated from California State
        University, Long Beach in May 2020 with a bachelor's degree in computer
        science. I am currently seeking an internship or an entry-level position
        in front-end development.

        From the moment I have written my first script in Python, I knew that
        computer science is the career choice for me. It has allowed me to
        challenge myself and to improve on my skills, not just in programming,
        but also on creativity and team-working. I hope to produce high-quality
        and beautiful websites that will be used and appreciated by many.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to my passion in web development, I am a coding instructor
        at Code Ninjas Cerritos and Fullerton, and an active volunteer for the
        Tzu Chi Foundation
