      <h2>My life at a glance</h2>
      <p>
        I am based in California my entire life. I've been passionate about
        computers ever since I played video games when I was young. I knew that
        a career related to computers would be a perfect option for me
      </p>
      <p>
        I obtained a Bachelor's in Computer Science from California State
        University, Long Beach in 2020. From the moment I have written my first
        script in Python, I knew that coding is something that I want to do in
        my life. It has allowed me to challenge myself and to improve on my
        skills, not just in programming, but also on creativity and team-working
      </p>
      <p>
        After I have graduated from CSULB, I was a bit lost on what I wanted to
        do with my degree, since there are various routes that I could've taken.
        I ultimately decided with a front-end web developer role, which allows
        my to express my creativity in the websites I make
      </p>
      <p>
        I am currently working at Code Ninjas, Cerritos and Fullterton, as a
        coding instructor. Working here combines two of my passions: programming
        and working with kids. I have tutored students with Scratch, and
        JavaScript, Lua, and C# languages to help them build video games. In
        addition, I have developed and led my own coding camp that received 95%
        positive feedback from students.
      </p>
      <p>
        Apart from my programming passions, I formerly served as the president
        for the Tzu Chi Collegiate Association at CSULB. This volunteering
        organization focuses on humanitarian aid, medicine, education, and more.
        I have devoted over 300 hours of my time serving this organization and
        it has been a life-changing experience for me.
