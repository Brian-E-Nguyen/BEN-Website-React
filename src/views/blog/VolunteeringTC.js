          <h2 className={classes['blog__header']}>Starting My Journey</h2>
          <p>
            I started my Tzu Chi journey back in my freshman year of university
            in 2016, where I attended the Tzu Chi collegiate chapter of CSULB
            (also known as CSULB Tzu Ching). I heard about this organization
            from a friend in my class who attends their events. I heard that the
            organization holds volunteering events, so I decided to check it
            out. When I attended one of their meetings, I was surprised that
            they do a lot more than just volunteering; their volunteering
            efforts focus on a wide range of aspects, such as environmental
            protection, education, medicine, and disaster relief. In addition,
            they also focus on humanitarian culture and vegetarianism. I was
            intrigued and wanted to do more with this organization, so I
            participated in their volunteering events.
          </p>
          <p>
            My first volunteering event with them was at a medical outreach at a
            Tzu Chi medical clinic, where Tzu Chi volunteers provided free
            medical services, like vision, acupuncture, and flu shots, for those
            in need. For my volunteering role, I helped with Spanish
            translations and medical form fill outs. It was a fun experience for
            me to help others in need.

            Becoming an Officer / Starting My Passion in Photography
          </h2>
          <p>
            During my first year with CSULB Tzu Ching, one of the officers
            couldn't fulfill her historian position. This position involves
            taking photos for the organization at events for documentation
            purposes. I was interested in this role because I had a DSLR camera
            that I didn't use much and thought this opportunity would help me
            develop my photography skills, so I applied to the role. The officer
            board decided that I was a good fit for it. The president told me
            that their decision wasn't based on my photography skills, but
            rather my experience and dedication to the organization. I was
            elated for the opportunity to work with the officers, develop my
            photography skills, and help contribute to CSULB Tzu Ching.

          <h2 className={classes['blog__header']}>Tzu Ching Social Day</h2>
          <p>
            The biggest event CSULB Tzu Ching has ever held was Tzu Ching Social
            Day on February 25, 2017. This event is where Tzu Ching members from
            various southern California colleges gather at one college to hang
            out and know each other. CSULB Tzu Ching was the host of that year's
            Social Day event, and the theme for that event was environmental
            protection. Various Tzu Chings from other colleges, like UC Irvine,
            UC San Diego, and UC Southern California, attended this event. The
            CSULB Tzu Ching officer board taught the attendees how Tzu Chi
            promotes environmental protection by using recycled plastic to make
            clothes and promoting vegetarianism. This event was also the first
            event where I fulfilled my new historian role, and it was one of the
            most memorable events that we've hosted.

            Bridging the Gap for CSULB / UCI Collaborations
          </h2>
          <p>
            One day during the summer of 2017, I saw a senior-center
            volunteering event posted on UCI Tzu Ching's FaceBook. I was bored,
            so I contacted them to volunteer with them. At that event, UCI Tzu
            Ching and I socialized with the seniors and performed to help
            brighten their day. In addition, I was able to meet all of UCI Tzu
            Ching's officers and advisors.
          </p>
          <p>
            UCI Tzu Ching held another volunteering event during the summer,
            which is a tutoring event. In this, we would tutor kids grades
            three, four, and five on reading, writing, math, and arts & crafts.
            I used to tutor children when I was in elementary school, so
            attending this tutoring event brought back memories; it was also a
            pleasure tutoring the children with UCI Tzu Ching.
          </p>
          <p>
            That day helped me form connections with the UCI Tzu Ching officers.
            We hung out after the tutoring event at a restaurant, and we got to
            know each other more. In the months / years that followed, I would
            continue volunteering with UCI Tzu Ching, which eventually led to
            them collaborating with CSULB Tzu Ching. This collaboration
            continued today, all because I was bored on a summer day.

            Becoming the <em>Only</em> Officer for CSULB Tzu Ching and Leading
            It When No One Else Would
          </h2>
          <p>
            It started around 2018 when CSULB Tzu Ching started to experience
            rough years. The number of members who attended our events
            eventually dropped; not many were interested in our organization. At
            that time, I couldn't figure out why. Not only did this hurt our
            events, but it also hurt our chances of getting new officers to help
            us for the following school years. In 2018, we only had two officers
            who led CSULB Tzu Ching: Jessica, then president, and me, the
            vice-president. Our events did not get many members, which caused me
            to be frustrated and depressed that our efforts would have been for
            nothing.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the 2018-2019 school year ended, we were unable to gain any
            interest in officer positions. Jessica wasn't able to be president
            the next school year because she was graduating the following
            semester. And me? I wanted to give up. I didn't want to put any
            effort into this organization if it would be for nothing. My
            advisors at the time persuaded me to continue for one more year with
            their support, so I did. I went into the 2019-2020 school year as
            the only officer for CSULB Tzu Ching.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the 2019-2020 school year started, advisors, a few past
            members, and I volunteered at the club fair event. We got around 100
            people to sign up for our mailing list across two days. Even though
            that number is high, my expectations were low. In the past, we've
            achieved that same number, but we received low turnout rates for our
            first general meetings; I wasn't expecting many people to attend our
            first meeting this year either.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first meeting was on September 9, 2019. I arrived at the meeting
            room at least an hour early to set things up. While I was there, all
            I thought to myself was that only around five people would show up.
            I would just get through this meeting and get it over with. Twenty
            minutes before the meeting happened, one person showed up. I thought
            that was strange because we never had someone show up to a meeting
            that early. Then, a few minutes later, another person showed up.
            Then, another person showed up. And another person showed up. And
            another person showed up! Outside of the room, there was a line of
            people waiting to get in, and I was like "OH MY GOSH! WHAT IS
            HAPPENING?!?! WHY ARE THERE SO MANY PEOPLE?" Not only that, past
            officers and members of CSULB Tzu Ching showed up, my friend from
            high school showed up, even my dad showed up. From that point, I
            felt like I was going to cry.

            Revitalizing CSULB Tzu Ching / Current Times
          </h2>
          <p>
            From there point on, CSULB Tzu Ching saw success in its events. We
            had many members attend our event, and we've gained more interest in
            our organization, not just our events, but also our values. I was
            grateful that the advisors and I inspired a new generation of
            officers for the next school year. When the school year ended, CSULB
            Tzu Ching was functioning for the following years and is still
            functioning as I'm writing this. I'm glad my officer journey ended
            on a high note. As an alumni, I continue to support this
            organization, whether maintaining the CSULB Tzu Ching website,
            providing photography at events, or advising current officers.

            If there is anything that I've learned during my journey, it's this:
            don't give up to prevent things from getting worse, but rather don't
            give up to prevent things from getting better.
