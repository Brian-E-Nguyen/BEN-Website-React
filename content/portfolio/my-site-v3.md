# My Site v3 - Nuxt3

This website iteration is a rebuilt version of my React site using Nuxt3,
keeping the original design intact while introducing new pages and an updated
technology stack.

One of standout features that drew me to Nuxt is the `nuxt-content` package, which
streamlines my blog content and helps me focus more on content creation and less
on technical details. Other features that stood out to me are server-side rendering that helps improve SEO, auto import of components, amazing dev-tools out of the box, and simplified code structure compared to React's.

I just have a preference for Vue and its technologies over React simply because
it was the first frontend framework I had the opportunity to work with
