* All Elite Network
All Elite Wrestling (AEW) is an American wrestling company based in
Jacksonville, Florida. Since its inception in 2019, AEW has changed the
landscape of professional wrestling. It provided a great alternative for new and
old wrestling fans, and is considered the second largest professional wrestling
company behind Word Wrestling Entertainment (WWE).

For years, fans have been wanting a streaming service that provides convenient
access to live shows and archived content; this includes AEW's quarterly Pay-Per
Views, weekly TV shows (Dynamite and Rampage), and weekly YouTube shows (Dark
and Dark Elevation)

The *All Elite Network* is the ultimate unofficial streaming service for fans of
All Elite Wrestling to access the AEW library of amazing content. This project
is currently a work in progress.

** Personal Notes
Watching professional wrestling is one of my biggest passions. I have been an
active fan of AEW since its start in 2019, and it has made me proud to be a
wrestling fan. One of the most requested things that AEW fans have requested is
a streaming platform. I wanted to make this app as a design mockup for what the
streaming platform might look like. I am still hoping there will be an official
app in the future.
