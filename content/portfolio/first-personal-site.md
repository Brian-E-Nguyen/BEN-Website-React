## Personal Notes

Creating this website was more than two years in the making. I started
developing this back in 2019 with the concepts that I have learned from Colt
Steele's Web Dev Bootcamp. The reason why this project took longer to complete
was that I was eager to create my website midway through the course, so I used
concepts that I already knew; however, I didn't know enough concepts to develop
it, such as routing, file organization, components, and app deployment. This led
me to become unmotivated to complete it sooner than I expected. I also had to
take some time off from the boot camp to focus on my studies at CSULB.

After I graduated in 2020, I wanted to finish the boot camp to gain more
knowledge on web development. It was a difficult and time-consuming journey, but
it was all worth it in the end. I took the new concepts that I've learned from
that boot camp and completely reworked my website.

I decided to retire this version of my website for many reasons. The biggest one
is how slow this website performs without paid hosting. Since I did use
traditional HTML files to markup my website, sending requests to the server
every time when going to different pages will cause the website slow down.
Switching to a front-end framework using the single-page-application
architecture will not only make my website faster, but it will also cost me less
money
