# Just Married! And Launching Our New Site

> 24 Dec, 2023

Hello! It's been a while since I've made any updates to my website. I have been
pretty busy with life and work, so I haven't had much time to do so.

But, exciting news, I want to say that Thu and I just got married on the 17th of September, 2023!
This is the happiest moment in my life. We were accompanied by so many of our
friends and family, who I am extremely grateful that they were a part of this
momentous occasion.

I've developed a new site: [brian-and-thu.com](https://brian-and-thu.com) to
document our life and our journies. Our entire wedding album is on there, so
feel free to check it out if you'd like.
